# Random Fractal Tree Generator

A random fractal tree generator built using the HTML5 Canvas API.

## Key Features 

 ![Tree Example](/tree-example.png)
 
1. Button and branch colour matches. 
2. Length, angle and branch width randomly calculated into generateRandomTree() function.
3. Branch curve also randomly generated.
4. Additional styling with shadowBlur and shadowColor.

## Things learnt/practiced:

1. Creating interactive projects with the Canvas API.
2. Generating randomness using Math.random and Math.floor. 

## Challenges I overcame:

1. Refreshing tree structure after each generation was challenging but was solved with the help of ctx.restore() to restore a saved state.
